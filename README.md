# DNase

This folder contains a pipeline to select positive and negative enhancer regions using DNase seq from the epigenetic roadmap.

## positives

Here we will select regions that are always active over all samples

## negatives

here we will select regions od open DNase accessibility that are only active in one tissue (e.g. blood) but not in any  other tissue.
